		So, you are interested in calculating your alcohol consumption, in alcohol units, where one
		alcohol unit is equal to 10 ml (millilitres) or 7.89 g (grams) of pure alcohol. It's not a
		difficult calculation, if you know the volume of the drink in millilitres (V ml) and the
		percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV%). Then:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Alcohol Units = V &times; ABV &divide; 1000</strong>
		<br />
		(where V is in millilitres and ABV is a percentage)
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, consider 1 pint of 5% ABV beer in an English pub. UK pints are 586 ml. <br />
		(US pints are smaller, at 473 ml.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Then:</strong>
		586 &times 5 &divide; 1000 = 2.93 alcohol units
	</p>

		That's pretty straightforward. But how to calculate the volume if you pour yourself a glass of
		wine, or of Scotch, at home? You may have a measuring cup, or jug, in the kitchen but they are
		not so accurate for small measurements in millilitres &ndash; and drinking a fine single malt
		out of a measuring cup does seem like sacrilege. If you have a digital kitchen scale, you can <strong>
			weigh
		</strong>
		the drink &ndash; and then convert the weight to volume, using the specific gravity of the drink.
	</p>
	<p><strong>From Weight to Volume</strong></p>
	<p>
		Due to the magic of the metric system, 1 g of water (at 4&deg;C) has a volume of 1 ml. At room
		temperature, the volume to only 1.002 ml so we can safely stay with the 1:1 ratio.
	</p>
	<p>
		The specific gravity of <strong>wine</strong>
		is usually within 1% of that of water (i.e., it has pretty much the same density as water). So, 100&nbsp;g
		of wine has a volume very close to 100&nbsp;ml.
	</p>
	<p>
		The specific gravity of <strong>beer</strong>
		is not as close to 1 as is wine, usually in the range of 1.010 to 1.020. So, 100 g of beer has a
		volume of 98 to 99 ml.
	</p>
	<p>
		Beer is usually sold by volume from taps in bars or restaurants, or by the bottle with the
		volume stated on the label. A conversion to volume is not usually required. But, if you brew
		your own beer, you may need to weigh it. (And, if you are home-brewing, you may own a hydrometer
		and be able to measure its specific gravity quite accurately.)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Spirits,</strong>
		with their high alcohol content, have specific gravities in the range of 0.940 to 0.980. So using
		the 1 g = 1 ml can cardduce up the 6% error in the volume which might be significant if you're considering
		whether another drink might put you over your weekly allowance.
	</p>
	<p>Now, the calculation is as follows:</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Alcohol Units = W &divide; SG &times; ABV &divide; 1000</strong>
		<br />
		where W is the weight of the drink in grams and SG is its specific gravity
		<br />
		(so that W &divide; SG is the volume in millilitres)
	</p>
	<p>For example, consider 50 g of fine Scotch whisky:</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Then:</strong>
		50 &divide; 0.95 &times 40 &divide; 1000 = 2.11 alcohol units
	</p>
